    "# Python Code Hierarchy and Logical Order\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the hierarchy and logical order in Python helps in grasping how code is organized and executed. Hereâ€™s a structured view of various Python constructs and their logical order:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hierarchy and Logical Order in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Module Level**\n",
    "   - **Imports**: Modules and packages are imported at the top level.\n",
    "   - **Global Variables**: Variables defined at the module level.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Definitions**\n",
    "   - **Class Definition**: Classes are defined using the `class` keyword.\n",
    "   - **Class Variables**: Variables defined within the class but outside any methods (shared among all instances).\n",
    "   - **Methods**: Functions defined within a class, which can be:\n",
    "     - **Instance Methods**: Operate on an instance of the class and access instance attributes via `self`.\n",
    "     - **Class Methods**: Operate on the class itself rather than instances, accessed using `@classmethod` and `cls`.\n",
    "     - **Static Methods**: Do not operate on instances or the class, defined with `@staticmethod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Function Definitions**\n",
    "   - **Function Definition**: Functions defined using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "   - **Local Variables**: Variables defined within the function, only accessible inside that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Control Structures**\n",
    "   - **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `elif`, `else` blocks determine the flow of control.\n",
    "   - **Loops**: `for` and `while` loops iterate over sequences or execute code blocks repeatedly.\n",
    "   - **Exception Handling**: `try`, `except`, `finally` blocks manage exceptions and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Code Blocks**\n",
    "   - **Indentation**: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. All code within the same indentation level is considered part of the same block.\n",
    "   - **Comprehensions**: List comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and set comprehensions allow for concise and readable code for creating collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Expressions and Statements**\n",
    "   - **Expressions**: Combinations of variables, operators, and function calls that evaluate to a value.\n",
    "   - **Statements**: Lines of code that perform actions, such as assignments (`x = 5`), function calls (`print(x)`), or control flow operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Built-in Functions and Methods**\n",
    "   - **Built-in Functions**: Functions that are always available (e.g., `print()`, `len()`).\n",
    "   - **Methods**: Functions associated with objects (e.g., `list.append()`, `str.lower()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Hierarchy in Code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Module Level\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",

    "    class_var = 5  # Class Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.instance_var = value  # Instance Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "    def instance_method(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def class_method(cls):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def static_method():\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Function Definition\n",
    "def my_function(param):\n",
    "    local_var = 20  # Local Variable\n",
    "    if param > 10:\n",
    "        # Control Structures\n",
    "        for i in range(param):\n",
    "            # Loop Block\n",
    "            try:\n",
    "                # Exception Handling\n",
    "                pass\n",
    "            except Exception as e:\n",
    "                pass\n",
    "            finally:\n",
    "                pass\n",
    "    return local_var\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code Blocks and Expressions\n",
    "result = my_function(15)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Comprehensions\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]  # List Comprehension\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modules** are at the top level, encompassing global scope and imports.\n",
    "- **Classes** define structure and behavior with class variables and methods.\n",
    "- **Functions** handle specific tasks with local scope.\n",
    "- **Control structures** manage the flow of execution.\n",
    "- **Code blocks** are defined by indentation and handle grouped statements.\n",
    "- **Expressions and statements** execute operations and perform actions.\n",
