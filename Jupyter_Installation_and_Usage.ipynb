    "# Installing Jupyter, Starting JupyterLab, and Uploading a Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Install Jupyter\n",
    "First, you need to install Jupyter on your system. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install jupyterlab --user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Start JupyterLab\n",
    "Once the installation is complete, you can start JupyterLab. Run the following command in your command prompt or terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "C:\\Users\\Ceres\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python312\\Scripts\\jupyter-lab.exe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will start JupyterLab and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8888`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Uploading a Notebook File\n",
    "Follow these steps to upload a Jupyter notebook file into your JupyterLab instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open JupyterLab:**\n",
    "   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8888` in your web browser if it hasn't opened automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Navigate to the Home Directory:**\n",
    "   - In the JupyterLab interface, you'll see a file browser panel on the left side.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Upload the Notebook File:**\n",
    "   - Click the \"Upload Files\" button (an upward-pointing arrow) in the file browser panel.\n",
    "   - Browse to the location where your notebook file is saved (e.g., `Tweepy_Installation_and_Usage.ipynb`) and select it.\n",
    "   - The notebook file will be uploaded to the current directory shown in the file browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Open the Notebook File:**\n",
    "   - Once the file is uploaded, you should see it listed in the file browser.\n",
    "   - Double-click on the notebook file to open it in a new tab within JupyterLab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Select the Kernel\n",
    "When you open the notebook, JupyterLab may prompt you to select a kernel. A kernel is the execution environment for your code. To select the appropriate kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose the Kernel:**\n",
    "   - When the \"Select Kernel\" dialog appears, choose `Python 3` or the kernel that corresponds to the Python environment where you installed Tweepy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Notebook:**\n",
    "   - Once the kernel is selected, you can start running the cells in the notebook.\n",
    "   - To run all cells, go to \"Run\" > \"Run All Cells\" from the JupyterLab menu.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, run each cell individually by clicking on the cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Notes\n",
    "- If you encounter any issues with kernel selection, you can list available kernels by opening a new terminal in JupyterLab and running:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  jupyter kernelspec list\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you will have JupyterLab installed, running, and ready to use with your uploaded notebook file.\n"
